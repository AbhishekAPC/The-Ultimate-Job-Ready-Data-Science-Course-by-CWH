### 🌍 Why is Data Science Important?

In today’s data-driven world, information is everywhere—from websites and mobile apps to smart sensors and wearables.

Organizations use this data to:

* Make better decisions *(e.g., which product to launch next)*
* Predict outcomes *(e.g., weather, stock prices)*
* Automate tasks *(e.g., self-driving cars)*
* Personalize experiences *(e.g., Netflix, YouTube)*

### 🧭 Key Steps in Data Science

1. **Data Collection**

   * Gather raw data from sources like APIs, databases, IoT devices, web scraping, etc.

2. **Data Cleaning**

   * Fix errors, remove duplicates, handle missing values
   * *(Fun fact: this takes up to 80% of a data scientist’s time)*

3. **Data Analysis**

   * Use statistical tools to explore and find patterns in data

4. **Model Building**

   * Apply machine learning algorithms to make predictions

5. **Interpretation & Communication**

   * Visualize and present findings to stakeholders for decision-making
